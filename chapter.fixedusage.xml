					home before dark. 如果你想天黑前到家就抓紧时间。 2. We'd better
					leave her alone since she is so mad.
					既然她那么生气，我们最好让她自己呆着。 3. We'd better not bother him.
					我们最好不去烦他。

					会话记忆 A: It is reported that the temperature is going
					to drop dramatically tonight. 有报道说今晚会大幅降温。 B:
					Really? 真的吗？ A: Yes. So you'd better dress warmly
					before you go out. 真的。你出去之前最好穿暖和一点儿。 B: I will.
					Thanks for telling me. 我会的。谢谢你提醒。
